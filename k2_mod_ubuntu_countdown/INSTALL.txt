Just a simple block thats shows the countdown to the next release of ubuntu and a download button for the desktop edition and server edition.

Install:
extract
root/blocks/block_ubuntu.php to blocks/block_ubuntu.php
root/images/block_images/block/ubuntu_logo.png to images/block_images/block/ubuntu_logo.png
root/images/ubuntu_desktop.png to images/ubuntu_desktop.png
root/images/ubuntu_server.png to images/ubuntu_server.png
root/styles/_portal_common/template/blocks/block_ubuntu.html to styles/_portal_common/template/blocks/block_ubuntu.html
then just add a new block i suggest adding it as a center block cause its a little to big for a left or right block.
to use the block image thats included: when making the block pick ubuntu_logo.png you may have to purge the cache first.
in the contrib folder there is 2 images for a dark theme just put them in the images directory and purge the cache.

you can update the countdown for the next release by doing the following.
open:
block_ubuntu.php
find:
<iframe src="http://djazz.mine.nu/files/ubuntucountdown/" width="180" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="0">Ubuntu countdown</iframe>
replace:
to whatever the new code is which you will find on http://www.ubuntu.com/community/countdown

future development:
